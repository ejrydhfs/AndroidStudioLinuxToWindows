# AndroidStudioLinuxToWindows

aims to work without a gradle installation on windows to avoid errors on Android studio running on windows related to missing paths, and will also set the project path

on linux the gradle path issue doesn't occur so this tool doesn't support it


Also includes a project renamer for files, folders and code, and a tool to pack files locally into an archive based off of .gitignore
